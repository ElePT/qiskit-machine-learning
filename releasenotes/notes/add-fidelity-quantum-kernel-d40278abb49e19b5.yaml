    Added a new implementation of quantum kernel. This implementation leverages the fidelity
    primitive (see :class:`qiskit.algorithms.state_fidelities.BaseStateFidelity`) and provides more
    flexibility to end users. A new hierarchy is introduced:

      - A base and abstract class :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.BaseKernel` is
        introduced. All concrete implementation must inherit this class.
      - A fidelity based quantum kernel
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.FidelityQuantumKernel` is added. This is a direct
        replacement of :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel`. The difference is
        that the new class takes either a sampler or a fidelity instance to estimate overlaps and
        construct kernel matrix.
      - A new mixin class :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.TrainableKernelMixin` is
        introduced to generalize ability to train quantum kernels.
      - A trainable quantum kernel
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.TrainableFidelityQuantumKernel` is introduced. This
        is a replacement of the existing :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel` if
        a trainable kernel is required. The trainer
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.algorithms.QuantumKernelTrainer` now accepts both
        quantum kernel implementations, the new one and the existing one.
