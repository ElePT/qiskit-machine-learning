    Introduced two new classes, ``EffectiveDimension`` and ``LocalEffectiveDimension`` 
    for calculating the capacity Qiskit quantum neural network models through the 
    computation of the Fisher Information Matrix. The local effective dimension bounds 
    the generalization error of QNNs and only accepts single parameter sets as inputs. 
    The global effective dimension (or just ``EffectiveDimension``) can be used as a 
    measure of the expressibility of the model, and accepts multiple parameter sets.
